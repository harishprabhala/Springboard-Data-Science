Capstone project proposal 2:

Facebook user engagement predictive analysis 

Facebook is not just a social networking company anymore. It is a media behemoth where hundreds of millions of users come to consume news everyday. In this context, it is pertinent to analyze and predict how the users are reacting to the news content so as to improve user engagement, which will ultimately help drive ad revenue.  

a.	Goal: To analyze and predict Facebook user engagement metrics based on half a million news posts.  

b.	Client: This project targets Facebook as the client. Based on the current data points on half a million news posts, we can build a machine learning model to learn and predict the user engagement. This will help Facebook or any other news media company to better understand their users and to create more engaging content on Facebook going forward.

c.	Data: I will be using Facebook news posts data collected from 2012-2016.
  
d.	Analysis:
•	Conduct EDA on the engagement metrics of different types of news posts, for example politics, world, sports, local news etc.
•	Conduct EDA on the engagement metrics on the posts by different news agencies.
•	Time series analysis of the user engagement over the four-year time period.
•	Convert the engagement metrics into categorical data and train the machine learning models to learn the user sentiment/engagement.
•	Using the trained machine learning models to predict the engagement characteristics of a particular news post.
